# Sales Data Analysis and Dashboard

Welcome to the Sales Data Analysis and Dashboard project! This project showcases my skills in data manipulation, cleaning, analysis, and visualization using pandas. The aim is to analyze sales data to derive meaningful insights and create a dashboard to visualize these insights.

## Project Overview

The project involves the following steps:

1. **Data Collection**: Loading the sales dataset.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values and correcting data types.
3. **Data Exploration**: Initial exploration of the dataset.
4. **Data Analysis**: Calculating key performance indicators (KPIs).
5. **Data Visualization**: Creating visualizations to represent the data.
6. **Dashboard Creation**: Building a simple dashboard in Google Colab.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `data/`: [Directory containing the sales dataset.](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shreyanshverma27/online-sales-dataset-popular-marketplace-data)
- `notebooks/`: [Google Colab Notebook with the analysis and visualizations.](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1B5Z9pIqhkmaUmdB3mdCZhsNjuauW8HkG?usp=sharing)
- `README.md`: [Project documentation](https://github.com/pqwevg4/Sales_Data_Analysis/blob/main/Sales%20Data%20Analysis/README_Sales_Data.md).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Google Colab

# Data Collection

The dataset used for this project includes columns such as Transaction ID, Date, Product Category, Product Name, Units Sold, Unit Price, Total Revenue, Region, and Payment Method.

# Data Cleaning

- Handled missing values by filling or dropping them.
- Corrected data types for columns.

# Data Analysis

- Calculated total revenue and total quantity sold.
- Identified the top 10 best-selling products.
- Analyzed sales trends over the last year.
- Grouped and aggregated data for insights at different levels (monthly, quarterly, yearly).

# Data Visualization

- Created bar charts and line charts to represent sales by region and sales trends over time.
- Utilized pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for visualizations.

# Dashboard Creation

- Built a simple dashboard in Google Colab to display key insights, with interactive elements using Plotly for enhanced visualization.

# Key Insights

- **Total Revenue**: $80567.85
- **Total Quantity Sold**: 518
